current problems

if both players have the same hand we have know way of knowing which is higher (ie. a pair of queens is equal
 to a pair of twos) FIXED MOSTLY

i will fix this by setting the last value in the hand (hand[4]) to be the highest card 
and in the event of a tie, we check the last value to see who won

this works already for: a high card, a straight, A royal flush, A flush, and a straight flush (becuase
 the cards are already ordered by rank)

i need to do this for:
 a pair --> DONE BUT NEEDS REWORK
 two pair
 set --> DONE
 fullhouse --> DONE
 four of a kind --> DONE

 NEEDS TESTING
 the DeclareWinner method in the Game class need rigorous testing with all possible two hand combos

 i have solved all besides for a Two Pair

 a minor problem with Pairs,
 if both players hold the same pair, the game will return a tie withour checking the high card
 need to fix this
