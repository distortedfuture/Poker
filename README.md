# Poker

A console based poker game

each player is given a hand of 5 cards and a chance to switch up to 2 cards to try and make the best hand.
This is modeled after 5 Card Draw Poker, and plays in a similar fashion.
please feel free to use this resource to build your own games and apps.
The logic for determining the higher hand in the event of a tie with a pair or two pair is still being implemented so please take that into account.
